Notes:
If you look at 'a' which a first part of query, which acts as a base query and maximum features come 'a'.
And we join with 'b' to fetch the title_tag column, by joining on keyword column from both queries 'a' and 'b'.

And there are a bunch of derived columns, that is a bit unclear from the point that, it is not clearly mentioned in the video too.
I have left that query empty, you can run the whole query. You will be able to get the output.
