Automated Workflow for Quality Enforcement
1.	Pre-Commit Hooks Configuration:
o	Set up pre-commit in the repository.
o	Add SQLFluff and DBT-Check to the pre-commit-config.yaml file.
o	Run pre-commit install to activate hooks.
2.	Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline:
Use GitHub Actions to set up a CI pipeline that runs on each PR. This pipeline should include:
o	SQLFluff: Run linter checks.
o	DBT Tests: Execute DBT tests to ensure models are correct.
o	DBT Run: Optionally, run a DBT job to build models in a staging environment to catch runtime errors.
Example GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/dbt_ci.yml):
3.	Enforce Code Quality in CI:
Configure the CI pipeline to block merging if any of the checks fail. This ensures that only code adhering to the quality standards is merged into the main branch.
4.	Monitoring and Alerts:
Use Prefect or Airflow to orchestrate DBT jobs and monitor their success. Set up alerts using AWS SNS or other notification systems to notify the team of any job failures.
